# JS Seat Booking Application

## Overview:

After 2 years in the web-development industry, I have realized that by far my greatest weakness is a sound understanding of pure JavaScript.

My projects have mostly utilized React as the front-end framework, and as the complexity of applications has increased, the need for a deeper understanding of JavaScript has surfaced (via countless hours of not even knowing where to start debugging very basic problems).

I have been 'carried' through my projects through React, and am looking to further expand my front-end knowledge via implementing some (admittedly basic) vanilla JavaScript projects from scratch.

I hope to document my learning process through these projects, to both illustrate my abilities as a front-end developer, and also to remind myself where I started.

This is my first one.

## Plan

I found a fun example of a movie theatre seat-booking application that I believe will serve as a good test for the recent learning in classes and event handling.
